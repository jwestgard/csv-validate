This is a place to post ideas as we begin conceptualizing the csv-validate project.

1. The ultimate goal is to allow for the validation of CSV data according to a flexible set of rules defined in a schema file.
2. The tool must deal elegantly with non-printing control characters that often creep into CSV files when exported from Excel.
3. The tool should produce reports of anomalies (violations of schema) and statistics about CSV data.
4. The tool should allow the user to make batch corrections to data, and should facilitate the correction of anomalies in the data.
5. The tool should allow for local correction and validation of CSV data before import into other systems.
